Germline reference output

The airrflow artifact for a germline source is not a samplesheet: it is a
reference tree that IgBLAST and Change-O read. This module is to the reference
sources what Airrflow.py is to the dataset sources -- the one place that knows
the shape of the output nf-core/airrflow expects, kept out of the sources
themselves so a second reference source inherits it unchanged.

This module holds the builders that turn downloaded germline FASTAs into the two
directory layouts airrflow consumes: a reference_base of per-chain FASTAs, and --
only when asked, because it needs the BLAST+ binary -- an igblast_base of BLAST
databases plus the internal_data and optional_file trees mirrored from NCBI. The
base class germline sources extend, ReferenceSource, lives in
immvoke.Sources.Germline, kept there rather than here so this module never
imports from immvoke.Sources and the two stay free of an import cycle.

The reference_base keeps the source's own FASTA verbatim, gaps and all, exactly
as airrflow's bin/fetch_references.sh leaves it. Cleaning (gap removal, dedup)
happens only when the BLAST database is built, so nothing that reads the
reference for its IMGT numbering, such as Change-O's germline reconstruction,
loses it.

def checkAuxCoverage(out_dir, plan):
    """
    Find J alleles the mirrored auxiliary file does not name.

    IgBLAST looks a J germline up in the auxiliary file **by name**, unlike the
    V delineation file, which it transfers by alignment. A J allele with no row
    there gets no CDR3 and no productivity call, silently -- igblastn reports
    ``V-J frame: N/A`` and no CDR3 sub-region rather than failing.

    The auxiliary file mirrored here is NCBI's, so it covers the names IMGT
    publishes. A reference naming its J alleles otherwise -- OGRDB's mouse sets
    call them ``IGKJ0-4JXG*00`` -- is not covered, and nothing else would say so.

    The remedy is to build an auxiliary file from the reference itself and pass
    it to igblastn with ``-auxiliary_data``. Immvoke does not build one: that
    belongs with the pipeline that runs IgBLAST. Reporting the gap is what it can
    usefully do, so the names needing rows are known rather than guessed at.

    Arguments:
      out_dir (Path): the igblast_base being built.
