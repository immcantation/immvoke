IMGT/GENE-DB historical releases (JamieHeather/genedb-releases)

IMGT's GENElect serves only the current release, so a reference pinned to an
older release cannot be re-fetched from IMGT itself. Jamie Heather's
genedb-releases repository fills that gap: it archives GENE-DB release by
release, each a directory named ``<access-date>_<source>_<release>`` holding the
bulk ReferenceSequences FASTAs, which carry the same pipe-delimited IMGT headers
as GENElect.

This module is what ``download --from`` uses to reconstruct an IMGT release. It
resolves a release tag to the archived directory -- exactly when the archive
holds it, or the closest release with a warning when it does not -- fetches the
bulk FASTA, and filters it down to one species' reference chains. Because IMGT
serves only the current build, a pinned mouse reference in particular is a
best-effort reconstruction; ``download --compare`` against the original is how a
caller confirms it matches.
