Download provenance

What was fetched, from where, when, and what it hashed to. The raw mirror is the
one artifact a user cannot regenerate from anything else in the output directory,
so it is the one that most needs a record of its own origin.

This is deliberately not a samplesheet. A samplesheet is an airrflow input and
names one file per sample; raw source files are not valid airrflow input in
either mode, so describing them in that shape would invite feeding them to a
pipeline that cannot read them. This file answers a different question: what is
in this directory and where did it come from.
