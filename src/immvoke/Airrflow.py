nf-core/airrflow samplesheets

The column set and the hygiene rules follow the mapping already in use in
Rmd/airrflow.Rmd, with two corrections noted at the point they are applied.

A samplesheet is a derived artifact of a data format, not a format in its own
right: its filename column has to name exactly one file per sample. Requesting
both AIRR and FASTA therefore produces two samplesheets, each internally
consistent, rather than one that has to choose.

A samplesheet describes every unit converted into its output directory, not just
the units of the run that happened to write it last. Downloading in several
passes is the normal way to assemble a dataset, so writing it fresh each time
would silently orphan the files of every earlier pass. Rewriting is therefore a
merge: see mergeSamplesheet for what that guarantees.

    Merge freshly converted units into the rows already in a samplesheet.

    Three guarantees, all aimed at making a repeated download additive rather

    - A unit already described keeps its sample_id, so identifiers a user has
      already referenced downstream stay valid when the sheet grows.
    - New units are appended in resolved order with the next free sample_id,
      so the numbering never renumbers what came before.
    - For a unit seen again, a value already in the file wins over the newly
      derived one wherever it carries information. Re-running fills in blanks and
      replaces placeholders, for instance once detail page enrichment supplies a
      tissue, but never overwrites a field edited by hand. sex is not derivable
