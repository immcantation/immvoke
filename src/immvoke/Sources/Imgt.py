IMGT/GENE-DB

IMGT exposes no data API. Its GENE-DB GENElect page takes a numbered query and a
chain and returns an HTML page with the FASTA embedded in its second ``<pre>``
block; the first holds the query echo. A query can fail and still return HTTP
200, so a valid answer is not the status alone but the presence of that second
block with sequence in it, which is what isValidResponse checks and the weekly
API canary relies on.

One germline file per (species, chain) is fetched, matching how airrflow's
bin/fetch_references.sh drives GENElect: query 7.14 for V, D and J nucleotide,
14.1 for constant (7.5 for the mouse kappa and lambda constants, which 14.1 does
not serve), and 7.3 for the translated V. The files are written into the
reference_base with their IMGT headers and gaps intact; see immvoke.Reference
for why cleaning is deferred to the database build.
