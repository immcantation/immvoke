"""
AIRR-C germline sets blended with IMGT

A germline reference that takes each locus from the source that curates it best:
the immunoglobulin V, D and J from OGRDB's AIRR-C sets, and everything OGRDB does
not cover -- all of the T-cell receptor, and the immunoglobulin constants that
are not in a published set -- from IMGT. It is the reference nf-core/airrflow
builds for its ``airrc-imgt`` database type.

Rather than reimplement either source, this composes them: it asks the OGRDB
source for the immunoglobulin sets and the IMGT source for the gap, tags each
download with which one it came from, and lets each build its own files back into
one reference tree, so an OGRDB allele lands as ``airrc_...`` and an IMGT allele
as ``imgt_...`` exactly as they would from the sources alone. Amino acid V is not
included, matching what airrflow's airrc-imgt build uses.
