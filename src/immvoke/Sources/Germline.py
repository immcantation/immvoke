Germline reference sources

A germline reference is a set of allele sequences. IMGT and OGRDB provide them,
and ReferenceSource turns a download into the airrflow reference tree through
buildReference, reusing SourceBase's download machinery: searchUnits, fetchUnit,
the schema and the HTTP client. The output shaping itself lives in
immvoke.Reference.

SourceBase also declares readUnit and normalizeChunk, the conversion step for
sources that emit AIRR records; a germline source has nothing to convert, so
those two are filled in here with a clear error rather than left for each source
to repeat.
