Antigen specificity annotation: query-vs-reference receptor comparison

For each row of a query AIRR table, find every row of a fixed reference AIRR
table it agrees with -- one annotation per query row (`query_row`,
`n_hits_total`, `is_unique_hit`, `hit_ids`). This is the third pipeline
stage: download a specificity database (`immvoke specificity iedb download
bcr`), which already lands as a real AIRR rearrangement TSV, then annotate a
user's own AIRR table against it as the reference.

Three ways to decide a hit today:

    runExactAnnotation        a single column, byte-identical, CompAIRR
                              accelerated (hash-based lookup, optionally
                              gated by exact V/J-gene agreement)
    runFuzzyAnnotation        one or more columns, up to `max_mismatches`
                              substitutions allowed (pooled across columns
                              if more than one), pure Python
    runLevenshteinAnnotation  a single column, up to `max_edits`
                              substitutions/insertions/deletions combined,
                              pure Python (rapidfuzz)

runPairedExactAnnotation builds on runExactAnnotation for the case where a
query row is one chain of an antibody rather than a self-contained unit: it
runs the exact criterion once per chain (heavy, light) and reconciles the
two per antibody, classifying each as agreeing with the same reference
antibody on both chains, one chain only, or neither.

runExactAnnotation requires the compairr binary
(https://github.com/uio-bmi/compairr, Rognes et al. 2022, Bioinformatics),
built from source -- no external deps beyond a C++11 compiler and make:

    git clone https://github.com/uio-bmi/compairr.git
    cd compairr && make

then either put the resulting `compairr` binary on PATH, or pass its path as
`compairr_bin=`. compairr compares sequences literally and has no concept of
the "X" wildcard runFuzzyAnnotation gives unresolved (e.g. PDB-derived)
residues, and hard-errors on an empty/missing sequence value rather than
treating it as a length-0 field -- see runExactAnnotation's docstring for how
those rows are handled instead.

runLevenshteinAnnotation has neither the wildcard handling nor the
length-bucketed index the other two share: Levenshtein distance lets a query
and a candidate differ in length, so length can't prefilter candidates, and a
wildcard has no clean meaning once an alignment can shift position. It also
takes only a single column, unlike runFuzzyAnnotation -- see its section
header for why edit distance does not pool across columns the way Hamming
distance does.

Substitution-matrix-weighted (BLOSUM) annotation is intentionally not
included in this first pass -- see the sibling project this was ported from
(`analysis/matching/matching.py` in specificity-annotations) if it is needed
later.

    Classify each query antibody by whether the *same* reference antibody

    An antibody is two rows of an AIRR table -- a heavy chain and, where
    present, a light chain -- sharing one `cell_id` and told apart by
    `locus` (`IGH` for heavy, `IGK`/`IGL` for light). Agreement on a chain
    is runExactAnnotation's criterion (exact V-gene, exact J-gene, exact
    CDR3), run once for the heavy rows and once for the light rows; a
    reference antibody counts toward "both" only if its `cell_id` appears in
    *both* chains' hit sets for the query antibody, not merely in each

    reference antibody and whose light chain happens to match an unrelated

        PATH.

# ── indel-tolerant annotation (Levenshtein) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Unlike runFuzzyAnnotation, there is no length-bucketed index and no
# 'X'-wildcard handling here: Levenshtein allows a query and a candidate to
# differ in length, so a per-column length key can't prefilter candidates, and
# a wildcard has no clean meaning once an alignment can shift positions.
# Candidates are only pre-filtered by `exact_cols` (e.g. V-gene, J-gene), then
# compared to every query brute-force within that block. Also unlike
# runFuzzyAnnotation, this only ever takes a single seq_col: edit distance
# summed across multiple columns independently aligned doesn't correspond to
# any one alignment of the concatenated sequence, so it does not generalize
# the way Hamming distance pools cleanly across columns.
