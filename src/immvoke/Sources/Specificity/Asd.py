"""
ASD (Antigen-Specific antibody Database) - Ab-Ag pairs as a Delta Lake

ASD (https://naturalantibody.com/agab/) publishes its whole collection as a
Delta Lake (Parquet partitions plus a _delta_log transaction log) staged in a
Google Drive folder behind a Colab notebook; there is no plain HTTP file to
GET. fetchUnit therefore reaches for gdown rather than the shared
HttpClient, and what it downloads is one folder rather than one file.

A table is not an index into many separately downloadable files: the Delta
Lake itself *is* the data unit, so there is exactly one. ASD has no HTML
search form, so harvestSchema returns a hand curated snapshot rather than
one built from a live page; the one filterable field (dataset) is the
controlled vocabulary observed directly in the Delta Lake, since the Drive
folder offers no per-dataset export to filter server side.
