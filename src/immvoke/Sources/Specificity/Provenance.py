Download provenance for specificity sources

A separate writer from immvoke.Provenance.writeDownloadMetadata: a
specificity download represents a database's current state rather than one
more addition to a growing repertoire dataset, so each run replaces the
record instead of merging into it. Kept apart from Provenance.py itself so
this does not change what repertoire sources rely on.

    Write the provenance record for a specificity download directory.

    Unlike Provenance.writeDownloadMetadata, this always replaces the file
    rather than merging into whatever was already there.

    Arguments:
      out (Path): the download root. The file is written at its top level.
      source (str): the specificity database name.
      table (str): the table (or 'all') downloaded.
      filters (dict): the filters the user supplied.
      limit (int): the table cap, or None.
      units (list): unit records from Provenance.buildUnitRecord.
      schema (SourceSchema): the snapshot the query resolved against, if known.
      license (str): the source's data license, if known. Recorded so a reader
        of this directory alone, with no access to immvoke's own docs, still
        knows the terms the data was obtained under.
      citation (tuple): the source's requested citation(s), if known, for the
        same reason.
      formats (tuple): the normalized shape(s) written this run: 'tsv' for a
        source-column dump, 'airr' where the source's collection is AIRR
        shaped (see SourceBase.airr_collections). A run spanning several
        tables can produce both.

    Returns:
      Path: the file written.
