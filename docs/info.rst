Citing downloaded data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``immvoke``'s own license (below) covers the tool, not the data it downloads.
Each remote source distributes its data under its own license and asks to be
cited in its own way; downloading through ``immvoke`` does not change either
obligation. Run ``immvoke sources list`` to print the license and citation
for every source, and check ``data_license`` / ``data_citation`` in the
``download_metadata.yml`` written alongside a download for the record tied to
that specific dataset.

OAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from `OAS <https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/oas/>`__ is distributed
under a `CC BY 4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ license. In exchange, OAS
asks that both of the following be cited:

- Kovaltsuk A, Leem J, Kelm S, Snowden J, Deane CM, Krawczyk K. Observed
  Antibody Space: A Resource for Data Mining Next-Generation Sequencing of
  Antibody Repertoires. *J Immunol*. 2018;201(8):2502-2509.

IMGT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from `IMGT <https://www.imgt.org/genedb/>`__ is governed by the `IMGT terms
of use <https://www.imgt.org/about/termsofuse.php>`__: it is free for academic
research on condition that IMGT is cited. IMGT asks that the following be cited:

- Lefranc MP, Giudicelli V, Duroux P, et al. IMGT, the international
  ImMunoGeneTics information system 25 years on. *Nucleic Acids Res*.
  2015;43(Database issue):D413-D422.
  doi:`10.1093/nar/gku1056 <https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku1056>`__

The ``airrc-imgt`` blend uses IMGT data too, so its downloads carry this
obligation as well as the OGRDB one below.

OGRDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from `OGRDB <https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/>`__ is distributed under a
`CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ license. In
exchange, OGRDB asks that the following be cited:

- Lees WD, Busse CE, Corcoran M, et al. OGRDB: a reference database of inferred
  immune receptor genes. *Nucleic Acids Res*. 2020;48(D1):D964-D970.
